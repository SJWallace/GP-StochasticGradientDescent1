# Dataquest.io guided project
As part of completing online data science qualification, there are a number of guided projects that help build a portfolio of work

# Project info
The purpose of this project was to use stochastic gradient descent regression to build a model to predict gym attendance for a college gym

# Outcome
A model was built, but feature engineering improved the model substantially compared to hyperparameter optimisation
